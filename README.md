# 👥 Customer Segmentation Analysis
**Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Clustering**

## 📌 The Challenge
How can a business understand its customers without pre-defined labels? I used unsupervised learning to group customers based on spending habits and income.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
* **Algorithm:** **K-Means Clustering**.
* **Optimization:** Used the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
* **Visualization:** Created 2D/3D scatter plots to visualize the distinct customer segments.

## 📊 Key Results
* **Optimal Clusters:** Found [e.g., 5] distinct segments.
* **Business Value:** Identified a "High Value, Low Frequency" group that is perfect for targeted marketing.
